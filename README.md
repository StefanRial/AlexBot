## Installation:

### To use this bot, you need 3 things
1. A discord application and bot user
2. An OpenAI account with a set up payment plan
3. Access to the gpt-4 model

### Install the required packages

- openai
- discord

### Open config.ini and change the following values:

1. **YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID_HERE**

2. **YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_API_KEY_HERE**

3. **YOUR_OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID_HERE**

4. **YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE**

5. You can now set your history length, I recommend no more than 100. You can also change the bot's identity and behavior by changing the system_message.

Now you can invite your bot to your server. It needs message and editing permissions.
Then run main.py.

## Usage:

- Allow the bot to use any channels you want it to use. It can naturally talk and remember. You do not need to use a command.
